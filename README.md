## **General info**

**Date**: April, 2021  
**Duration**: 2 Days.

We had to make a presentation for a talk about the technologies we are using and it occurred to me to do it with JavaScript instead of using the typical PowerPoint, and together with the **Reveal.js** library and creating small components with **Vue 3** came up 👌.

## **Demo**

You can try it using the [Demo](https://vantea-presentation.netlify.app/)
